                We present egglog, a fixpoint reasoning system that unifies Datalog and equality saturation (EqSat). 
                Like Datalog, egglog supports efficient incremental execution, cooperating analyses, and lattice-based reasoning. 
                Like EqSat, egglog supports term rewriting, efficient congruence closure, and extraction of optimized terms. 
                We identify two recent applications -- a unification-based pointer analysis in Datalog and an EqSat-based floating-point term rewriter -- 
                that have been hampered by features missing from Datalog but found in EqSat or vice-versa. 
                We evaluate our system by reimplementing those projects in egglog. 
                The resulting systems in egglog are faster, simpler, and fix bugs found in the original systems.
